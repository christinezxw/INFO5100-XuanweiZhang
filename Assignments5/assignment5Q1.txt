Q1:

<the difference between final and finally>

final:
when used in a field, to make it unchangable after initialization.
when used in a method, to make its subclasses unable to override it.
when used in a class, to make it can't be extended by other classes.

finally:
use by the end of "try{}catch{}", no matter where the procedure goes, it will end up in "finally{}" and excecute the lines within it.
